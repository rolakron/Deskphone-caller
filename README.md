# Deskphone-caller
A bash-script for placing calls on Cisco IP-phones from the terminal. This script is mainly intended for handling tel-URI, i.e. when you click on a tel-link, it place a call on the deskphone.
Put the call-script into the /usr/local/bin/ folder and the call.desktop into /usr/share/applications/ folder. Put deskphone.png into /usr/share/pixmaps/
